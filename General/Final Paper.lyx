Context/Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Although use of thermal imagery currently poses significant advantages for
 24/7 surveillance in terms of the visibility of human, animal and vehicle
 targets under all environmental conditions, a key limitation is the lack
 of colour information.
 Many current approaches to the problem of cross-camera person re-identification
, or the camera-to-camera tracking of pedestrian targets, rely on colour
 features 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gong2014"

\end_inset

.
 Person re-identification across multiple cameras is a key research problem
 within the domain of visual surveillance and a key challenge for the future
 deployment of thermal sensing as an autonomous sensor technology.

Aims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop a system that would build upon and
 extend the range of existing thermal image detection, tracking and classificati
on approaches.
 The first step for this would be to be able to detect a person within thermal
 imagery in real time, distinguish a person from other objects and track
 a person moving through a scene in real time.
 We would then implement features/attributes from the literature studied
 and carry out a first pass or initial framework for re-identification using
 these features/attributes.
 The system must be able to re-identify 3+ people within a test video sequence
 in real time using multiple cameras.
 This would then be extended by implementing some more advanced features/attribu
tes and extending the re-identification ability to 6+ people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This system will be implemented in C++ using the widely used OpenCV computer
 vision library 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "opencv_library"

\end_inset

, and will be run simultaneously on multiple video files, each being able
 to access the same array of previously identified targets.
 The first stage is real time person detection, which is done using mixture
 of gaussians background subtraction, histogram of oriented gradients or
 haar cascade person detection and a six dimensional kalman filter per person
 to facilitate tracking a person and store their position, velocity and
 bounding box dimensions.
 From here, each of these people will have some of their features stored.
 The basic features used are Hu moments, the histogram of thermal intensity
 and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) of the target.

\color black
 From here, more advanced features are implemented, these are the thermal
 correlogram and optical flow.
 To comparison and re-identification will be performed using mahalanobis
 distance.

\begin_layout Abstract

Results - EXPAND UPON THIS AND PUT IN STATS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Having carried out evaluation of the features, we established that histogram
 of intensities was the most effective feature, with thermal correlogram
 and optical flow also considered to be suitable for re-identification.
 We implemented a re-identification system as described in the method above,
 using histogram of intensities as our feature, and got very good performance
 on a single camera system.
 However, due to differing viewpoints, the multiple camera system did not
 perform as well, but still gave a good degree of accuracy in certain situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\series bold
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\color black
We conclude that the work carried out here is a useful starting point, as
 we have been able to approve or eliminate five potential thermal re-identificat
ion features and develop a classifier to use our best feature to create
 a functioning re-identification system over both a single camera and multiple
 cameras, across a range of people who have a variety of thermal signatures.
 Future work could look to investigate more features, try to explore the
 full potential of the thermal correlogram and optical flow, experiment
 with different camera viewpoints and improve upon the person detection
 system.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fundamental task for a distributed multi-camera surveillance system is
 to associate people across different camera views at different locations
 and times 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gong2014"

\end_inset

.
 This is referred to as the Person Re-Identification Problem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gong2014"

\end_inset

 and is an interesting and important problem within the field of computer
 vision, with many different approaches being taken to try and perform this
 process efficiently and reliably, mainly revolving around the use of features
 or attributes of a person 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Layne"

\end_inset

.
 This has been researched widely in colour space, but there has been very
 little research done on solving this problem in thermal space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many potential applications for this technology, but the most
 important in the modern world would be to support human intelligence organisati
ons.
 The surveillance data that a system like this can provide would be critical
 for crime-prevention, forensic analysis, and counter-terrorism activities
 in both civilian and governmental agencies alike.
 While this is currently widely used by human operators, these operators
 have to be trained, which offsets the utility of this approach with training
 and staffing costs.
 The implementation of an automated re-identification system is therefore
 of great interest, as it would be very useful in supporting these human
 operators and enabling them to achieve better results more efficiently.
 This would be particularly important in thermal space, as many of the features
 that we propose to use are complex and mathematically grounded, making
 them difficult for a human analyst to observe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the previous work, we can see that a substantial amount of research
 that has been done on person re-identification, but much of this relies
 on the visible spectrum, with attributes of the form “red shirt” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Layne"

\end_inset

.
 However, in the modern world, thermal imagery is often used for 24/7 surveillan
ce when varying environmental conditions are present.
 Therefore, it is important that an effective re-identification system is
 developed to utilise this area of surveillance.
 Whilst thermal imagery has many advantages, it is not able to identify
 colour, making attributes that rely on colour useless.
 Therefore, alternative features are required to facilitate re-identification.
 Recently there has been an increase in the amount of research into thermal
 tracking, and some focus on re-identification, although mainly in robotics,
 rather than in a distributed camera network, as discussed in

 answer the question

Which features of a human target are appropriate to facilitate re-identification
 in thermal imagery?

The challenges associated with answering this question are mostly due to
 the increased complexity of the features required in thermal space, as
 we do not have simple colour features available to us.
 Such colour features, as described in more detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Layne"

\end_inset

, have many applications from clothes colour to hair and skin colour.
 In thermal, we cannot use such simple features, so must think in a more
 complex way.

 shows five different views of the same person that our features must be
 able to re-identify as being the same person.

The first thing that we shall consider as a feature to solve the re-identificati
on problem is a measure of the size of the target person.
 Due to the single viewpoint of the camera, we need a measure of size that
 is position, scale and rotation invariant.
 For this purpose, we will use Hu moments, taking inspiration from the work
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "FlusserSukZitova2009,Dawson-Howe2014"

\end_inset

.
 The closest we can get to a colour value per pixel in thermal is the intensity
 of each pixel, so a histogram of these intensities per target will be a
 key feature for us to use.
 
\color black
We will also use the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptor as
 a feature for re-identification.
 
\color inherit
From here, we must consider more complex features.
 The first of these that we will consider draws inspiration from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Huang,Zhang2015"

\end_inset

, which suggest the use of a colour correlogram.
 This method gives an idea of spatial correlation of colours, and we will
 adapt it to get an idea of the spatial correlation of intensities.
 The other advance feature will be optical flow, which will be used to
\color black
 capture the gait (motion) characteristics of the person.

Aims of the Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this project is to investigate the above research question by
 developing a system that can detect a person within thermal imagery in
 real time, distinguish this person from other objects in the scene and
 track this person moving through a scene in real time.
 We would then implement three features/attributes, and use these to carry
 out a first pass or initial framework for re-identification.
 At this stage, the system must be able to Re-Identify at least three people
 within a test video sequence in real time using multiple cameras.
 This would then be extended by implementing two more advanced state of
 the art features/attributes and extending the re-identification ability
 to at least six people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Achievements of the Project - add references (to later in paper?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have managed to achieve a full evaluation of all the features being examined,
 with histogram of intensities being the best, and thermal correlogram and
 optical flow also being considered suitable for use in re-identification.
 We have developed a functioning real time person detection, identification
 and tracking system, and have built a re-identification system on top of
 this using histogram of intensities, and this has given us accurate results
 on a single camera.
 The problem becomes more complex in a multiple camera system, and although
 we do still see a reasonable amount of success from our system, the different
 viewpoints and larger number of targets reduces the accuracy of our classificat
ions

 to focus on the gathering and use of attributes for re-identification,
 emphasising the typical methods for attribute gathering and how to evaluate
 the usefulness and relevance of the attributes.
 This does not suggest any particular method, or carry out new research,
 but instead acts as a good summary of the current state of the art when
 it comes to gathering and using attributes.
 Many of the attributes normally used are simple, appearance based attributes
 such as gender, shirt colour, the presence of a coat or bag and hair colour.
 However, to increase reliability some systems use more complex attributes,
 such as movement path, scene position and posture.
 Such attributes require more complicated algorithms with greater computational
 complexity, but do lead to an increase in reliability.

Re-identification in colour is a widely researched area, particularly using

 Many of these methods are discussed in

, and have been widely researched and understood, so research has moved
 on to explore more complex methods.
 An important part of the current state of the art in this area is network
 layout and topology, as explored in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Here, the technique of distance vector routing is employed to get an idea
 of the relative locations of the cameras, enabling the system to prioritise
 the people seen most recently by the closest camera, as these are most
 likely to be correct.
 This is done by first analysing the overlap between cameras, and then computing
 distance vectors and probabilities of going from one camera to another,
 reducing the time complexity of the re-identification process in the majority
 of cases.

\end_inset

 is on a similar theme to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Martinel2016"

\end_inset

, but assumes a non-overlapping camera system.
 Each camera has entry and exit zones from its field of view, and if a person
 can get from one camera field of view to another they are directly connected.
 The system can then create what is referred to as a camera link model,
 using a temporal, spatial and appearance relation between the entry and
 exit zones of the cameras.
 These paths are obtained from training data, but the system itself learns
 how to recognise people by attributes, and uses the training data to estimate
 where they are most likely to have gone after leaving a given camera field
 of view.

The authors of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 propose a different method for feature based identification, using a feature
 projection matrix to project image features of one camera to the feature
 space of another, to effectively eliminate the difference of feature distributi
ons between the two cameras.
 The feature projection matrix is obtained through supervised learning.
 The proposed method aims to use a simple gradient descent algorithm to
 accelerate and optimise the re-identification process by compensating for
 the inconsistency of feature distributions captured by different cameras.

The work in

 emphasises the importance of making good use of all images and video frames
 captured of a target.
 The system proposed here creates a gallery of images of known individuals,
 with more images increasing the accuracy of the system.
 When a gallery exists for a target, this is referred to as multi-shot re-identi
fication, and single-shot re-identification when only one image is available
 in both the query and the gallery.
 For multi-shot re-identification, the authors propose to use geometric
 distance in another way by collaboratively approximating the query sets
 using all galleries, a method known as Collaborative Sparse Approximation.

Thermal Tracking and Use in Combination with Colour
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 details a motion tracking system that uses only the thermal space.
 Developing an effective and efficient method for this is becoming more
 and more important as the uses of thermal imagery increase.
 This system uses the Wigner Distribution, which includes both time and
 frequency, to enable it to create an association between spatial and temporal
 data.
 This helps to alleviate one of the major problems with tracking in thermal,
 which is the fact that temperature is not uniform across the body.
 Using this in place of feature-based tracking reduces the complexity of
 the system and therefore allows it to perform accurate tracking faster
 in real time.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Coutts2014"

\end_inset

, another system based on the relationship between spatial and temporal
 signatures in thermal is proposed, combining a human detection algorithm
 with the real-time compressive tracking algorithm.
 This algorithm uses bounding boxes, which surround an object to be tracked
 in subsequent frames.
 We can associate each bounding box with a set of features, both spatial
 and temporal in nature, and rematch this box with the target in subsequent
 frames.

\begin_layout Standard
Thermal tracking and identification also has applications in robotics, as
 stated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ciric2013"

\end_inset

.
 This is an additional challenge due to robot movement, so it will not have
 a consistent view of the environment.
 Therefore, thermal is useful to allow detection irrespective of the light
 level.
 This movement based consideration can be seen as relevant to our problem
 of multiple cameras, as each of these will be trying to detect the same
 target from a different position.
 This paper also discusses the issue of overlapping signatures of multiple
 people standing close together, and suggests the ‘fuzzy logic’ approach
 to solving it, which uses mathematical functions to determine how strongly
 an object is in the foreground or background.
 This approach is shown to have good results.

\end_inset

 in many respects, as it is also a person tracking and re-identification
 system for robotics, based on movement through a changing environment.
 The thermal imaging system filters out the background elements, and then
 uses a set of heuristics to determine if a hot-spot is a person or not.
 Experimentation shows that while it performs well in indoor environments,
 it can sometimes be confused in outdoor environments with high levels of
 clutter.
 The paper concludes suggesting a combined system of colour and thermal
 imaging.

 This method uses background subtraction without the need for pre-trained
 detectors, along with association based tracking, a fully automatic process
 which associates humans with identified tracks based on motion and appearance
 cues.
 Thermal is used in this system in order to resolve any problems with the
 illumination level.
 This was shown to be an effective method of re-identification.

The re-identification method proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 suggests using a mixture of colour, thermal and depth based imaging to
 improve accuracy of re-identification.
 The colour channel provides a colour histogram per body part, the depth
 channel provides a skeletal outline, and the thermal channel provides local
 structural information and difference from background.
 Combining the three of these gives a tri-modal dataset of attributes.
 The system must then determine if a person is new or if they have been
 seen before.
 Nearly all new persons were identified correctly as new, but some previously
 seen were misidentified as new due to significant changes in one or more
 of the spectra.

 One of the major problems that 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 addresses is that in thermal space, bringing a 3D environment down to a
 2D representation can lead to ambiguity due to overlapping thermal signatures.
 This is where the photogrammetry comes in, determining the 3D position
 using camera projection and target size.
 A Kalman filter is then applied to track the 3D scene trajectories of the
 targets.
 The results of this investigation show that it is an effective improvement
 to 3D localisation in thermal space.
 The assumption of human height as a constant introduces a statistical error,
 but this is small and is reliable in the majority of cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, an issue with the approach presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is the assumption of posture, or that a person is always standing at full
 height within a scene.

 target who may deliberately vary their posture to avoid detection.
 The work in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The posture of a target detected in a scene is estimated as a percentage

 Machine based machine learning regression.
 Like

Relation to this Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from the prior work discussed above, the research that has
 been put into re-identification in the past has been focused on colour,
 and the state of the art is moving away from the simpler features such
 as shirt colour and towards more advanced features to try and improve the
 accuracy of this system.
 However, in thermal imagery the majority of the research presented here
 is concerned with tracking a person or object, and not with re-identification
 across multiple cameras.
 This is where this project fits in, as we are tackling a problem that has
 not been effectively solved, and using some features that have rarely,
 if at all, been used for re-identification purposes.
 This puts us right at the state of the art of research in this specific
 area.
 As our interest is primarily centred on the features we are using, we will
 implement fairly basic and well understood techniques for person tracking,
 and then implement our set of features on top of this, as will be discussed
 in the next section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having established the problem that we want to solve, we will now break
 down the most important elements of our solution, giving an overview of
 the structure of our implementation, a description of the elements used
 for the person detection subsystem, a description of the features that
 we have used and and explanation of how we compare new detections to previously
 identified targets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementation Structure and Tools Used
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation will begin by opening each video file, or live camera
 feed, and concurrently running the real time target detection code on these.
 Each time this code identifies a person, it compares the features of this
 person to those of the other people that have been seen previously, and
 if they are deemed to be sufficiently similar to one of these people, then
 they are re-identified as the same person, else the system creates a new
 person object.
 Each of these person objects has an associated Kalman Feature position
 estimator and a set of features, and these are used to facilitate the compariso
n between targets, and are updated each time the target is successfully
 identified.
 This continues frame by frame until the video file or camera feed ends,

Many of the computer vision techniques that will be described in the next

 Therefore, the OpenCV library

 has been used to allow us to use stable, well tested code, giving confidence
 in the results obtained while enabling us to focus on the research and
 implementation of the features.
 The implementation will be developed in C++, using a text editor for code
 development and CMake for building and deployment of the system.
 GitHub has been used for version control and project organisation.

\begin_layout Subsection
Real Time Person Detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we can start concerning ourselves with feature based person re-identifica
tion, we must be able to identify whether a person is present in the image
 at all.
 This requires several stages, background subtraction, person identification
 and person tracking with position prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Background Subtraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first stage of this process is background subtraction from the static
 camera viewpoint.
 We use the Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) technique to facilitate this, taking
 inspiration from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zivkovic2004,Zivkovic"

\end_inset

.
 This technique works by building up a background model over, modelling
 each of the pixels using multiple Gaussians.
 Using a Gaussian over the last 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 frames, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is given by a parameter specifying the rate at which the background model
 is updated, is far more memory efficient than storing all of the pixel
 values across the entire video capture.
 This update rate is determined by the trade off between being fast enough
 to absorb objects that have become stationary into the background, and
 being slow enough to allow the detection of slow moving objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the program runs through the video, during each new frame, a Gaussian
 for each pixel is evaluated using a simple heuristic to determine which
 is most likely to correspond to the background model.
 Pixels that do not match closely enough with these background Gaussians
 are classified as foreground elements, and added to a new image in the
 code.
 Once these foreground pixels are identified and built into a foreground
 mask, erosion and dilation image operators 
\series bold

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\series default
 are used to clean up these results.
 From here, we use the contour detection algorithm from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Suzuki1985"

\end_inset

 to find the connected components, and draw bounding boxes around these
 contours.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 (a) shows the background model that the system has built up, the foreground
 of the image, the target identified and the bounding box associated with
 this target, taken from one frame of an example video used for testing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Person Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having identified the foreground objects, we must now determine whether
 they are people.
 This implementation has two options for this, the first of these is using
 Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dalal"

\end_inset

.
 This method works by performing edge gradient calculation on the bounding
 box identified by the background subtractor.
 From here cell histograms are computed, with each of the histogram entries
 filled by gradient magnitudes.
 These histograms are then used to create overlapping block histograms of
 the adjacent cells.
 These block histograms are then concatenated to give a HOG descriptor,
 a high dimensional vector.
 This HOG descriptor is then passed to a pre-trained machine learning algorithm,
 in this case a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
 If this comes up with a positive identification, then it is classified
 as a person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative to HOG is the use of a Haar cascade detector, proposed in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RainerLienhartandJochenMaydt2002,Viola"

\end_inset

.
 This method works by training a cascade of simple classifiers based on
 Haar-like image features, with are all simple and weak, but when combined
 together, give good results and area quick to evaluate.
 The cascade is build up using the boosting machine learnig technique, where
 each new classifier that is added to the cascade prioritises the examples
 that the previous classifiers did not classify correctly.
 As this cascade is build up, it focuses on the section of the target that
 is most likely to result in a definitive classification, speeding up processing
 time.
 We have used an existing cascade of classifiers trained to recognise people
 in thermal imagery, and it gives us effective results.
 
\series bold
REFERENCE THE CASCADE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for the inclusion of both methods here is that there is a trade
 off between them.
 HOG is a slightly more accurate identifier, but it is slow, even within
 the confines of the bounding box identified.
 The Haar cascade is much faster, but gets a slightly inferior classification
 rate.
 For this reason, the option exists to change between the two systems, depending
 on whether speed or accuracy is important.
 A real world example of this trade-off would be in a surveillance system,
 if the operator is looking to Re-Identify people from live video input
 they would use the Haar cascade, but if they waned to Re-Identify people
 from pre-recorded video footage, they would use HOG.
 The output of both systems looks much the same, and is displayed in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Real-Time-Person"

\end_inset

 (b), where the red box represents the search area given by the background
 subtractor with additional padding, and the green box represents the identified
 human target from HOG or Haar cascade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Person Tracking and Position Prediction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the target has been identified as a person, we need to track each identifie
d person.
 This is done by creating a new person object for each newly identified
 target, each with an associated Kalman filter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bishop"

\end_inset

.
 This is a commonly used position estimator in such tracking problems, and
 is important because it makes use of current information about a target
 to reduce the search space required in subsequent frames.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kalman Filter that has been implemented here is six-dimensional, storing
 the coordinates of the centre of the target, its velocity in each direction
 and the width and height of the associated bounding box.
 This is updated each time the target is detected and the implementation
 then calculates a predicted position for the target in the next frame of
 the video.
 This prediction is based on a transition matrix, which in this implementation
 keeps the velocity and bounding box dimensions the same as in the current
 state, and changes the (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

) position by adding the current velocity, as this is how much its position
 should change in the next frame if the velocity remains constant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With such a Kalman Filter associated with each person object, we know where
 each person is positioned within the distributed camera network.
 This can inform us as to which person any identified target is likely to
 be, due to their most recent position, and can speed up the comparison,
 as we know people cannot be in two places at once.
 It also helps us to reduce noise from the person detector, as we have a
 predicted size of the next classification of each person.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Real-Time-Person"

\end_inset

 (c) shows the output of this, with the red box showing the area identified
 as a foreground target, and the blue box is the predicted position of the
 target in the next frame.
 The green box from the person identification phase is omitted here to reduce
 the clutter in the image, but the process is still being performed to give
 us the measurement of target position in each frame.

Features for Re-Identification - MORE DETAIL IN HERE, MATHS WHERE APPROPRIATE,
 talk about normalisation for all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To properly associate and compare person objects, we now consider the features
 of each person that we have identified for the cross-camera re-identification
 task.
 Each feature is calculated on the region of interest given by the person
 detector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hu Moments - maths here if space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature enables us to calculate a measure of the distribution of shape
 of the target in a manner that are invariant to translation, scale and
 rotation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dawson-Howe2014"

\end_inset

.
 This method is derived initially from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hu1962"

\end_inset

, and we have taken inspiration from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FlusserSukZitova2009,Dawson-Howe2014"

\end_inset

 for its implementation in our system.
 When calculating this, we first detect the contours present in our region
 of interest 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Suzuki1985"

\end_inset

.
 We then use the largest of these contours to calculate spatial moments,
 which enable us to calculate central moments, which are invariant to translatio
n, or the position of the person in the image.
 These central moments enable us to compute scale invariant moments, and
 from these we can compute moment invariants, also called Hu moments, which
 are invariant to rotation, as well as retaining the translation and scale
 invariance of the central and scale invariant moments.
 There are seven of these Hu moments, and we normalise the values of these
 before passing them to the re-identification system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Histogram of Thermal Intensities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this pixel, we loop through our region of interest and tale the intensity
 of each pixel.
 From these intensity values, we create a thirty-two bin histogram is constructe
d from all the pixels.
 This size of histogram was chosen because it enables the feature to run
 quickly while still making use of many of the different intensity levels
 in the image, while also effectively ignoring small changes in pixels in
 each frame, as the intensities will not stay exactly the same, but are
 unlikely to change by eight or more and thus move to a different intensity
 bin.

\series bold
 
\series default
Each frame, a histogram for the newly detected target is build up, normalised
 and passed to the re-identification system.
 This is a useful feature as it can give a fair impression of clothing,
 as if one target is wearing a T-Shirt, for example, there will be more
 high intensity pixels than will be present for a target wearing a long
 sleeved shirt or jacket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Histogram of Oriented Gradients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have already discussed the process of Histogram of Oriented Gradients
 (HOG) when describing Person Identification in the previous section of
 this document.
 When being used for that purpose, the OpenCV function implementing the
 work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dalal"

\end_inset

 compares the HOG descriptor to a pre-trained support vector machine to
 determine if the target is within acceptable bounds of being a person.
 Here, we use the same feature vector, but instead of passing this to the
 support vector machine for classification as a human or not, we save this
 vector for each target, and use this as a feature of comparison for re-identifi
cation.
 This feature vector is very large, meaning the the processing time is impractic
ally slow, so we have had to simplify it to make it run in reasonable time.
 This simplification has been done by reducing the number of histogram bins
 from nine to four, and increasing the block size from eight to sixteen,
 giving us a much smaller feature to compare, and meaning that it runs quickly
 enough to be used in the re-identification system.
 As before, to aid in the comparison, this feature is normalised before
 being passed 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Thermal Correlogram
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this feature, we draw inspiration from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Huang,Zhang2015"

\end_inset

, which suggest the use of a colour correlogram.
 This method gives an idea of spatial correlation of colours, using a table
 indexed by colour pairs, where the 
\begin_inset Formula $k-th$
\end_inset

 entry for 
\begin_inset Formula $<i,j>$
\end_inset

 specifies the probability of finding a pixel of colour 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 from a pixel of colour 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in the image.
 We will apply a similar principle in our implementation, but instead of
 the colour values we only have access to thermal intensity values.
 Due to limitations of processing time, we cannot store the probability
 of each distance value for each intensity pair, as this makes the resulting
 featue vector too large to enable efficient comparison, so we have placed
 the distances into quite wide distance thresholds, creating a histogram
 of distances per intensity value pair, as we understand that while these
 thresholds are quite wide, they still give a sufficient picture of where
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hotspots
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are on the target, and how large they are.
 Even with this simplification, this feature works slowly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optical Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this feature is to capture the movements of the target within
 the bounding box.
 Optical flow is the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of
 brightness patterns in an image 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HornSchunck1981"

\end_inset

.
 The method employed here to calculate the optical flow values is the tensor
 based method proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Farneback2003"

\end_inset

, simply known as the Farneback algorithm, which uses quadratic polynomials
 to approximate the neighbourhood of each pixel in each frame, and then
 estimates the displacement of each pixel between frames based on knowledge
 of how these polynomials vary under translation.
 As suggested from this description of the algorithm, and unlike the other
 features we have implemented, this feature cannot be measured over a single
 frame, but must instead be calculated over the course of multiple frames.
 As mentioned when discussing the Correlogram, this feature vector is very
 large, and therefore takes a lot of processing time, making this not practical
 in real time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate this feature we use both the raw flow values that we have
 calculated, reduced only one value from the (x,y) values, and only considering
 every eight row and column as suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dawson-Howe2014"

\end_inset

.
 Another approach to this feature that we have tried is to create a histogram
 of the full range of raw flow values to attempt to enable us to make better
 use of all of the information available to us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparison Method - Mahalanobis Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method that we have employed for comparing these features and facilitating
 re-identification is primarily of our own design, making using of mahalanobis
 distance as the main point of comparison.
 This method has several stages, the first of which being the special case
 for the first person.
 As we have nothing to compare the first identified target to in the system,
 we immediately create a new person object for this target.
 We also assume that the next frame captured by the camera is this same
 first person, as the way our dataset has been recorded means that this
 will always be the case across all four cameras.
 Now that we have two feature vectors associated with this person, we can
 then calculate the mean vector and covariance matrix, which gives us an
 idea of the average value of each element of the feature vector, and how
 much each element is likely to change.
 The calculation of the mean vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is simple, as it is simply the sum of all vectors of the distribution,

, divided by the size of the distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The equation for this is 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{\mu}=\frac{\vec{x}_{1}+\vec{x}_{2}+...+\vec{x}_{n}}{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The covariance matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, is build up using the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $C(i,j)=\frac{[\vec{x}(1,i)-\vec{\mu}(i)][\vec{x}(1,j)-\vec{\mu}(j)]+...+[\vec{x}(n,i)-\vec{\mu}(i)][\vec{x}(n,j)-\vec{\mu}(j)]}{n-1}$
\end_inset

 to calculate the value that should go in each cell of the matrix.
 Now that we have the mean and covariance, we can compare these to each
 new target identified by the person detector, and calculate the mahalanobis
 distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mahalanobis distance, originally proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahalanobis1936"

\end_inset

, is a measure of the distance between one single piece of data and a distributi
on of this data, and relies on the mean and covariance of the distribution
 as has been discussed.
 This is calculated by the following equation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the mahalanobis distance and
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 is the feature vector of the new target.
 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\vec{x})=\sqrt{(\vec{x}-\vec{\mu})^{T}C^{-1}(\vec{x}-\vec{\mu})}$
\end_inset

.
 At a high level, the mahalanobis distance value gives an idea of how many
 multidimensional standard deviations the new data value is from the mean
 of the distribution.
 This multidimensional standard deviation is informed by the covariance
 matrix discussed above.
 Based on our evaluation of the features, we then determine a mahalanobis
 distance threshold, where the target is re-identified as one of the people
 already seen by the system if the mahalanobis distance is below the threshold,
 else a new person object is created.
 As anomalies are present in our dataset, we make this re-identification
 threshold quite wide, but then have a much tighter learning threshold.
 Only instances with mahalanobis distances less than this will be added
 to the dataset to avoid corruption of each target data signature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this new person object is created, we only have one data value associated
 with it, meaning that we cannot calculate a covariance matrix, and therefore
 cannot calculate the mahalanobis distance.
 As all of the people have similar covariance matrices, until we get a second
 classification for this person we will use the covariance matrix from one
 of the other people in the system as an approximation.
 After a second classification for this person, we can then calculate a
 covariance matrix for this person and use this for all future comparisons.
 Now that multiple targets exist, the one with the lowest mahalanobis distance
 will be chosen, rather than the first one to be below the threshold to
 try and ensure the best possible accuracy.

\series default
\emph default
This has been done by performing tests on one of our video files with an
 altered re-identification classifier to the one described above.
 We have a section of video taken from camera 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 of dataset 1 where one person is in the scene, over which the features
 of this person will be recorded, and each new frame will be compared against
 these using Mahalanobis distance as before.
 This person leaves the scene and a different person enters the scene.
 A timeout has been inserted into the code at this point, to prevent any
 chance of this new person being classified as the first person and corrupting
 the data.
 We can therefore measure the mahalanobis distances between this new person
 and the data recorded for the previous person at all points and determine
 if an incorrect classification is likely.
 A discriminative feature will be one that has a low mahalanobis distance
 for the right target and a high mahalanobis distance for the wrong target.
 These two people have fairly similar thermal signatures, and after examining
 our three datasets, we concluded that it was this section of video that
 was the best suited to the evaluation of our features.

Hu Moments proved to not be a very discriminative feature for the purpose
 of re-identification, Figure

(a), as the mahalanobis distances for both correct and incorrect targets
 are very similar.
 The first entry also has a comparatively large mahalanobis distance relative
 to the others, which we believe was due to the covariance matrix not yet
 allowing sufficient variation, as this feature seems to vary to quite a
 large extent.
 This feature is therefore not recommended for use in re-identification,
 and will not be used in the final system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Histogram of Thermal Intensities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
As can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance"

\end_inset

(b), the Histogram of Intensities was shown to be a very good feature, as
 the line for the incorrect person is always higher than the line for the
 correct target, and we can therefore determine a threshold that will be
 correct for the vast majority of classifications.
 This will be a very useful feature for re-identification, and will be used
 in the final system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Histogram of Oriented Gradients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The Histogram of Oriented Gradients is another feature that is not very
 discriminative for re-identification.
 All of the mahalanobis distances are very low, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance"

\end_inset

(c), but there is very little difference between the correct and incorrect
 target.
 We have simplified this feature to improve runtime, but testing with more
 complex HOG parameters did not improve the performance of this feature
 enough to make it usable for the re-identification.
 The low mahalanobis distance for all classifications and the fact that
 this feature cannot effectively discriminate between different people validates
 its use as a generic person detector earlier in the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Thermal Correlogram
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This feature has proved to be quite discriminative, as Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance"

\end_inset

(d) shows.
 However, there are some notable anomalies, which we believe are due to
 certain body parts being obstructed, such as a hand disappearing behind
 the persons back for a frame.
 Despite this, the performance of this feature is good even with the vastly
 simplified nature of the feature in this implementation, so we can expect
 that if our runtime constraints did not exist, it would perform even better,
 as these anomalies would probably not occur.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optical Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The Histogram of Flow is slightly discriminative feature, as the correct
 person has a smaller average mahalanobis distance than the incorrect target,
 but the two lines of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance"

\end_inset

(e) are close together and vary highly, meaning that it would be very hard
 to determine an effective re-identification threshold for using this feature,
 so it is therefore of very limited use to us when considering which features
 to use in our final solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
However, when just using the raw Optical Flow values that we have calculated
 from our region of interest, we have a far more discriminative feature
 than when we used these values to construct a histogram, as can be observed
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Performance"

\end_inset

(f).
 Even though we are only using every eighth row and column to enable this
 feature to run in an acceptable amount of time, these results show that
 it is one of our more discriminative features.
 If we did not have this runtime limitation, it would be reasonable to expect
 this feature to perform better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Re-Identification System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having evaluated the features, we now move on to the re-identification system
 itself.
 We need to decide on the best feature, or combination of features, to use
 with a re-identification threshold in order to get the best possible accuracy
 from the system.
 The best feature that we have is the Histogram of Intensities, but the
 Thermal Correlogram and Raw Optical Flow values are also discriminative
 features.
 We have therefore experimented with different combinations of these three
 features.
 The combination of all three gives good results, but runs so slowly that
 it would be impractical to use, as it does not run anywhere close to real
 time.
 Due to the size of the Correlogram, which runs slowly even when not combined
 with another feature, all of the combinations that involve this feature
 run slowly.
 All of these combinations of the discriminative features give good results,
 but they all introduce anomalies into the system, which would lead to the
 creation of new targets, which would then cause a split in the data stored
 for the correct person, or could be closer to the data of the incorrect
 person, leading to cross-pollution of the data.

In view of these anomalies and the issues that they may cause, the most
 discriminative feature that has the fewest anomalies and that runs in real
 time is using the Histogram of Intensities alone.
 Having decided upon using this feature, we will now implement this within
 the final re-identification system, using the full comparison method described
 previously in the Solution section, determining an effective re-identification
 threshold and learning threshold based on the results that we have collected
 for this feature.
 When this system is run on a single camera, the results that it gives are
 very good, as Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Single-Camera-Re-Identification"

\end_inset

 shows.
 Subfigures (a), (b) and (c) show different identification of different
 targets, while subfigure (d) shows the situation where two targets have
 crossed over.
 For the majority of this video, the system has a perfect re-identification
 rate for every target that it recognises as a person, until the first mistake
 occurs towards the end of the video.
 Despite this, across all our video files, the system has a long period
 of effective re-identification before any mistakes are made.

\begin_layout Standard
However, as the multiple-camera dataset introduces very different viewpoints,
 people observed from different cameras have differing characteristics,
 which means they are sometimes similar enough to be re-identified, and
 sometimes not.
 It is also more difficult to differentiate between people from some viewpoints,
 with camera 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 being the main source of this problem.
 We also rarely get a detection in camera 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma,$
\end_inset

 as the people are too close to the camera, and parts of them are cut off,
 meaning that the person detector does not pick them up.
 The result of these problems is many person objects loosely associated
 with each person, as if all of them are within the re-identification threshold,
 it will change often between them as individual classifications are by
 nature closer together than others.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MultiCam"

\end_inset

 shows our setup, as well as an instance of this problem of multiple targets
 associated with a single person.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the videos proceed, and more people enter the scene, we begin to get
 a Huge amount of targets in the system, and the output becomes very hard
 to gain any useful insight from.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DeltaProb"

\end_inset

 shows a small instance of this, as this person is far away and difficult
 to re-identify, so a new target is created for them for every frame they
 are identified in.
 This person takes the total number of targets in the system up a Huge amount,
 and from here the system struggles, as with so many targets, each frame
 is bound to be closer to a different one of them, or none of them, and
 will create a new target.
 This was from dataset 2, and at the end of the run we have over 200 targets
 in the system.
 Therefore, we can see that this system, while effective on a single camera,
 is ineffective over the four cameras used in this dataset.
 This figure also shows the problems with identifying targets at distance
 in the other cameras, and the lack of detections from camera

Evaluation

\begin_layout Standard
We will now evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of the research
 that has been presented here.

\begin_layout Subsection
Real Time Person Detection System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the primary focus of this project was to investigate the features and
 their viability for re-identification, we have implemented a fairly simple
 person detection system to give our features a platform to work on.
 While this performed well in the majority of cases, there were some issues
 associated with these methods, such as the detector cutting parts off people,
 giving us very different results, as if the head is not part of the classificat
ion, a significant thermal hotspot has been missed.
 In order to mitigate this problem, we have forced acceptable classifications
 to be larger.
 This removes many of these partial detections, although some do still occur,
 but it also means that we cannot identify people far from the camera.
 We have attempted to find a balance between these erroneous classifications
 and being able to classify targets at a distance, but this has not been
 completely successful.
 We also rarely get detections of people in camera 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 because the edges of the people are too close to the edges of the frame,
 meaning that this camera is providing little to the multiple camera system
 due to a weakness in the person detector.
 This should be addressed by future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the research that we have conducted here is in an area that has previously
 been largely unexplored, our first objective was to answer the research
 question 
\series bold
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series default
Which features of a human target are appropriate to facilitate re-identification
 in thermal imagery?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\emph default
This has been extensively explored in our results section, and we have effective
ly proved that Hu Moments and HOG are not suitable to be used for re-identificat
ion, and the Histogram of Intensities is suitable.
 We have also effectively established that while our more advanced features,
 the Thermal Correlogram and Optical Flow, are reasonably discriminative
 features in the form that we have implemented here, but have such a high
 level of complexity that they would need a more powerful computation system
 than the one used to perform this work if they are to be used to their
 full re-identification potential.
 We state in our aims for this project that the final system must run in
 real time on the video files that we are using, or at least reasonably
 close to real time.
 In order to achieve this aim we have had to greatly simplify these features,
 by only using every eighth row and column of the optical flow matrix and
 breaking the correlogram down to wide intensity and distance thresholds.
 However, with these simplifications these features perform worse than the
 Histogram of Intensities, so this is the feature we use for re-identification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Re-Identification System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have developed an effective classifier to measure the effectiveness of
 these features, by using the Mahalanobis distance between each new frame
 and the distribution of previous identifications of each target.
 For our effective features this classifier produces a clear difference
 between correct and incorrect classifications in the majority of cases.
 The problems that our classifier encounters are due to the anomalies that
 the features generate.
 The reasons for this have already been discussed, but on the majority of
 correct detections from the person detection system and using the Histogram
 of Intensities as our feature, our classifier functions very well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, a major weakness of our system is that fact that miss-classifications
 cause major problems for the re-identification system.
 For example, if we have a succession of classifications for a person, stored
 in the associated person object, and then a miss-classification leads to
 the data of another person being added to this person object, then the
 data is no longer exclusively the features of the original person.
 We refer to this as cross-pollution of the data, and if it occurs then
 the target that has become polluted is now useless to us, as it has data
 from the wrong person in it, so may continue to be matched with either
 of the two people whose data it contains.
 Also, now that this person object does not contain the data for just one
 person, the two people that have been misidentified as this object may
 now be closer to other unpolluted person objects, which will lead to further
 cross-pollution and to the data becoming meaningless.
 Therefore, the re-identification system is only effective until it begins
 making mistakes, and these mistakes become more and more prevalent when
 the system is applied to multiple cameras, as was discussed in the results
 section, with many of the misclassifications being traceable to camera
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations of Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A limitation that we faced in this project is associated with the infrared
 cameras that we used to record the data.
 As these are uncooled cameras, they require a thermal reset at regular
 intervals, to enable the cameras to calibrate themselves to correct for
 changes in background heat levels.
 While this calibration occurs, new footage is not recorded, and this leads
 to jumps in the video and some frames being repeated.
 To mitigate this, we compare every frame that comes in from the camera
 to the previous frame, and if they are identical then we ignore it.
 This stops the data per person from becoming skewed by repetitions of the
 same data value, but it does lead to some anomalies in the results, which
 can be seen as spikes in the graph, due to the sudden change in position
 of the person being tracked.

Appraisal of Project Organisation - would remove but in mark scheme
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the implementation of this system we have used a modular approach, implementi
ng each major component separately.
 This was a useful process to use as it enabled us to fully test and optimise
 each part of the system as much as possible, and eliminate as many of the
 errors and limitations as we could as they came up in each subsystem.
 Notably, we encountered difficulties with the Kalman filter, as although
 this is a well understood and often used technique, it was one of the elements
 of the OpenCV library that changed between version 2 and 3, meaning that
 much of the existing work that we looked at for this part of our solution
 functioned in a different way to how our system would, as we have used
 OpenCV version 3.
 We also had difficulties in the implementation of the comparison system,
 as we initially intended to use a Bayesian Classifier in a similar manner
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Fukunaga1990"

\end_inset

, but this did not function correctly with our data, and much time was used
 trying to get this to function before we decided that using the pure Mahalanobi
s distances was a superior solution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research that has been performed in this project has enabled us to effective
ly answer our research question, as we have shown that Hu moments and histogram
 of oriented gradients are not suitable for use in re-identification, histogram
 of intensities is suitable and performs fairly well, and thermal correlogram
 and optical flow are moderately effective in a simplified form, and need
 more computation resources if they are to use their full discriminative
 potential.
 We have used this information to create a functional re-identification
 system using the histogram of intensities feature and mahalanobis distance
 as a comparison method.
 This system has proven to be very good on a single camera system, and even
 on multiple cameras with similar viewpoints.
 A useful insight that our dataset provided was that while histogram of
 intensities is a very discriminative feature over the range of distances
 in the section of video that we used to measure the performance of the
 features, it is not as effective as a feature over more of a range of viewpoint
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many more potential features that could be used for re-identification,
 and therefore future work and extensions of this project should explore
 more of these features.
 It would also be worth exploring the full possibilities of the advanced
 features that we have discussed here, the thermal correlogram and optical
 flow, if we had sufficient computational resources to make use of the full
 detail that these features can supply.
 If we made use of multiple cameras in the same position, or stereo cameras,
 we will be able to get measurements of depth, and this will most likely
 be a better feature than Hu moments proved to be, which was our approximation
 of size.
 We could also consider the possibilities of using a different classifier,
 perhaps storing more information per each target, or incorporating the
 previous position of the target to improve the accuracy.
 We could also improve the person detection system to enable it to function
 at distance and not pick up small parts of people as different detections.
